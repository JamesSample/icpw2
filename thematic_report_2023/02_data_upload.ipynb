    "The database already contains some Armenian sites, but data has never been uploaded for them as previous submissions did not use the template (and the last previous submission was in 2012, comprising data from 2004 to 2008). This year, we have data for a new set of sites using the new template.\n",

    "There was an old ICPW site on Black Lake (`ME 01`), but data were never submitted using the template and have never been added to the database. This site is no longer considered suitable for ICPW, so adding the (rather limited) old data is no longer relevant. \n",

    " * There is a data template for \"Black Lake\", but it is not clear if this is the same as the original Black Lake site (which is apparently no longer suitable for ICPW anyway?).\n",
    " \n",
    " * There is a file named `crno_jezero_emep.xlsx`, which presumably contains data from the new EMEP station that we are supposed to be adding to ICPW. However, according to the e-mail chain, the new EMEP site was only established in 2019, whereas data in the file go back to 2000. Furthermore, the station co-ordinates for 2020 and 2021 are different to the co-ordinates for the new EMEP station given in the e-mail, and co-ordinates for years prior to 2020 are missing completely.\n",
